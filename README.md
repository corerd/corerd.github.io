# Corerd Website

Hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
at [https://corerd.github.io/](https://corerd.github.io/)

This website consists of static pages generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Jekyll installation

Required:
- Ruby version 2.4.0 or higher
- Gem Bundler
- GCC and Make

### Install prerequisites on Linux
Look at [Install dependencies](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu).

Install Ruby and build tools:
```
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
```

Avoid installing RubyGems packages (called gems) as the root user.
Instead, set up a gem installation directory for your user account.
The following commands will add environment variables to your `~/.bashrc` file
to configure the gem installation path:
```
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Install the bundler gem:
```
gem install bundler
```

### Install Jekyll (all platform)

Go to `docs` directory that has the Gemfile, and edit Gemfile commenting
the line `gem "github-pages"` and un-commenting the line `gem "jekyll"`.
Don't push the modified Gemfile to the origin repository,
but keep only a local copy of it.

Finally, run:
```
bundle install
```
The above steps are required only once.

## Build the site

Change to `docs` directory and run:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Your site will be also available on a local server at the address
