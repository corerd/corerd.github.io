# Corerd Website

Hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
at [https://corerd.github.io/](https://corerd.github.io/)

This website consists of static pages generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

If you want to build and test the site locally, follow this guide.

## Jekyll installation

Required:
- Ruby version 2.4.0 or higher
- Gem Bundler
- GCC and Make

### Install prerequisites on Linux
The following steps apply also on Windows WSL.

Look at [Install dependencies](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu).

Install Ruby and build tools:
```
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
```

Avoid installing RubyGems packages (called gems) as the root user.
Instead, set up a gem installation directory for your user account.
The following commands will add environment variables to your `~/.bashrc` file
to configure the gem installation path:
```
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Install the bundler gem:
```
gem install bundler
```

### Install Jekyll (all platform)

Clone `corerd.github.io` repository in your working directory,
go to `docs` subdirectory and open **Gemfile** with a text editor.

You'll find two lines like the following, the first commented, the second not:
```
#gem "jekyll"
gem "github-pages"
```

To build and run the site locally, un-comment the first line and comment
the second like this:
```
gem "jekyll"
#gem "github-pages"
```

**Don't push the modified Gemfile to the GitHub Pages repository**,
but keep only a local copy of it (see below).

Finally, run:
```
bundle install
```
The above steps are required only once.

## Build the site

Change to `docs` directory and run:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Your site will be also available on a local server at the address
[http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)


## Untrack Gemfile in local repository but keep at origin

**Gemfile** manages the site building and running.
You can configure Jekyll or GitHub Pages.

When you clone the repo, **Gemfile** is made to use GitHub Pages, then
you have to update its content to use Jekyll for testing purposes to build
and run your site locally.

If you want that GitHub Pages continues to serve your site,
**don't push your local Gemfile changes to the central origin repository**.

The safe way is to untrack **Gemfile** in your local repository. First of all,
check that .gitignore contains the following line (otherwise add it):
```
Gemfile*
```

Now open a terminal and move to the directory containing **Gemfile**,
then run the following command:
```
git update-index --assume-unchanged Gemfile
```

The above steps are required only once, after you cloned the repo.
Now you can update **Gemfile** to build and run your site locally,
and git will assume it has not been changed, so you wonâ€™t commit anything.

You can start track **Gemfile** again entering the command:
```
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged Gemfile
```
