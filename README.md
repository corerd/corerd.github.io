# Corerd Website

Hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
at [https://corerd.github.io/](https://corerd.github.io/)

This website consists of static pages generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

If you want to build and test the site locally, follow this guide.

## Jekyll installation

Required:
- Ruby version 2.4.0 or higher
- Gem Bundler
- GCC and Make

### Install prerequisites on Linux
The following steps apply also on Windows WSL.

Look at [Install dependencies](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu).

Install Ruby and build tools:
```
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
```

Avoid installing RubyGems packages (called gems) as the root user.
Instead, set up a gem installation directory for your user account.
The following commands will add environment variables to your `~/.bashrc` file
to configure the gem installation path:
```
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Install the bundler gem:
```
gem install bundler
```

### Install Jekyll (all platform)

Clone `corerd.github.io` repository in your working directory,
go to `docs` subdirectory and open **Gemfile** with a text editor.

You'll find two lines like the following, the first commented, the second not:
```
#gem "jekyll"
gem "github-pages"
```

To build and run the site locally, un-comment the first line and comment
the second like this:
```
gem "jekyll"
#gem "github-pages"
```

**Don't push the modified Gemfile to the GitHub Pages repository**,
but keep only a local copy of it.

Finally, run:
```
bundle install
```
The above steps are required only once.

## Build the site

Change to `docs` directory and run:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Your site will be also available on a local server at the address
[http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
