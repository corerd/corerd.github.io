  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    As a Software Engineer, I have over a decade of experience in 
    embedded systems design.<br>
    You can find my career in the <a href="work.html">WORK</a> page.
  <p>
    In the past, I developed security and data protection architectures
    for Electronic Fund Transfer devices such as PoS terminals.<br>
    Now I'm involved in power management multi-phase switching regulator SOCs
    at STMicroelectronics.<br>
    I also develop desktop applications in Linux, macOS and Windows platforms
    to handle the above devices for testing.
  </p>
  <p>
    My main development languages are C/C++ and Python, but I have worked with
    more, using a lot of tools and frameworks.<br>
    See my <a href="skills.html">SKILLS</a> page for details.
  </p>
  <p>
    All of what I did during employment is under NDA, but programming is not
    just work for me. I also enjoy developing software during spare time.<br>
    You can find my personal projects at <a href="https://github.com/corerd">GitHub</a>.
